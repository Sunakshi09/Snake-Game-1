# Snake-Game-1# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

![Snake Game Placeholder](/https://github.com/Platane/snk)

#This is my first project on how to create the Snake Game using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT... But first let me tell you about Snake Game History in brief. It originated in the 1976 two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food or apples eaten—often.
The aim of the game is to collect the food(dots) and avoid the obstacles. As you collect food, the snake gets longer so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself.

The projects consists of:-

1. Index.html:- Simple HTML page to open in a browser
2. Style.css:- Styling for the HTML page
3. Index.js:- logic file and functionality for the snake game

# Project Description

Snake Game is a free thinking game for childrens and adults like, Where the goal is to guide the snake to eat as many food as possible. I inspired by the old mobile games and one of my childhood game. But the purpose that i make this game is because the snake is one of famous game on Nokia 3310 before the smart phone is published in the market. And now i didn't see a lot of same snake game in the app store. In this case i decided to let's give it a shot and work on this project.

## Game Logic

The snake's turn has a logic that it can't retreat in the opposite direction. For example, it is moving left and can't turn directly right. Therefore, there are corresponding conditional judgments in turnUp, turnRight, turnDown and turnleft.
Your snake grows longer the more food or fruits it eats.
Collect as many fruits as you can to increase your score.
If you break the hit score an another hit score will show.
The game ends if you bump into the wall.

## Deliverables

Collision detection between snake and itself
Collision detection between snakes and obstacles
Collision detection between snake and food
Snake movement

### MVP Criteria

- Your game must be winnable and clearly shows there’s a winner.
- My game shows a clear and obvious winner.
- You must provide clear, easily accessible instructions on how to play the game.
- Instructions will be held on the main page of the site.
- Another thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
- To truly win Snake, players must fill up the entire map without hitting their tail, or snake itself or the wall
  around them.
- What you learn from playing Snake
- Playing snake can help improve hand-eye coordination and reaction time, since you'll have to act fast to keep the
  snake from crashing.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- I'm going to try to add in a game that has a few levels, and a few levels are easy, and the rest are hard.
  -create scoring board.
  -create a leaderboard that saves hit scores.
- Trying to make it simple because the simple graphics of the game make it easy to play.
