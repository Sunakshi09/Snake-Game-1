# Snake-Game-1# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

#This is my first project on how to create the Snake Game using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT... But first let me tell you about Snake Game History in brief. It originated in the 1976 two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food or apples eaten—often.
The aim of the game is to collect the food(dots) and avoid the obstacles. As you collect food, the snake gets longer so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself.

The projects consists of:-

1. Index.html:- Simple HTML page to open in a browser
2. Style.css:- Styling for the HTML page
3. Index.js:- logic file and functionality for the snake game

# Project Description

Snake Game is a free thinking game for childrens and adults like, Where the goal is to guide the snake to eat as many food as possible. I inspired by the old mobile games and one of my childhood game. But the purpose that i make this game is because the snake is one of famous game on Nokia 3310 before the smart phone is published in the market. And now i didn't see a lot of same snake game in the app store. In this case i decided to let's give it a shot and work on this project.

## Game Logic

Control the direction of the snake by turning it either up, down, left or right.
Your snake grows longer the more food or fruits it eats.
Collect as many fruits as you can to increase your score.
If you break the hit score an another hit score will show.
The game ends if you bump into the wall.

## Deliverables

> Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
> _Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!_
>
> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

### MVP Criteria

- Your game must be winnable and clearly shows there’s a winner.
- You must provide clear, easily accessible instructions on how to play the game.
- Another thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
- One more thing.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... _yet_. :)
